Code for ESP32-based DIY speaker
======================

This particular speaker is based on an ESP32 dev-module along with an I2S-DAC, DIY 40W Class-D amplifier and an DIY 18650-based battery pack, accompanied with various other IO-components. Wood construction with 3D-printed elements. Built as a hobby project with the intention of relatively good audio quality, EQ-controll and loudness.

The speaker is controllable by bluetooth.

The code should in theory work for most ESP32 + I2S-DAC modules with minor adjustments.
